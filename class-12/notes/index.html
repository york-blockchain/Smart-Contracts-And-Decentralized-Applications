## CSBC 2010 - Smart Contracts And Decentralized Applications

### Class 12: Advanced Smart Contracts - II

*Dhruvin Parikh*

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Class Plan
* Smart Contract Security
    * Vulnerabilities patterns
    * Mitigation
    * Analysis tools
* Applications
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Threat models

* Model 1: Contract writer is trusted
    * Must worry about all bugs we've discussed so far (overflows, function visibility, etc)
* Model 2: Contract writer may be malicious
    * Must worry about everything in model 1, as well as possibility contract writer added a hidden back-door
    * *Underhanded* contracts

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Obvious back-door

<pre class="hljs js">
    function soLongSuckers() public onlyOwner {
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
</pre>

<img src="solongsuckers.png" />

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## What about this?

<pre class="hljs js">
    uint256 ownerReward = 1 ether;

    function claimOwnerReward(uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        require(amount <= ownerReward, "too much");
        ownerReward =- amount;
        owner.transfer(amount);
    }
</pre>

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Plausible deniability

<pre class="hljs js">
    uint256 ownerReward = 1 ether;

    function claimOwnerReward(uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        require(amount <= ownerReward, "too much");
        ownerReward <span class="highlightRed">=-</span> amount;
        owner.transfer(amount);
    }
</pre>

* Should be `-=`, not `=-`
* This bug lets owner steal all ETH in contract
    * How?
* If detected beforehand, owner can claim:
    * *Oops sorry. It was just a typo, I wasn't trying to steal anything, I promise*

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Contract upgrades

* Some contracts are designed to be *upgradeable*
    * **Good**: Owner can fix bugs in the contract before bad guys can exploit them
    * **Bad**: If owner is a bad guy, can add back-doors
* Because a contract's code cannot be changed, upgradeable contracts are implemented using *proxy contracts* (contracts that call other contracts)
    * An upgrade changes the contract address that the proxy will call

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Withdrawal pattern

* It is better to record how much is owed to each address:
<pre class="hljs js">
    owed[addr1] += payout1;
    owed[addr2] += payout2;
</pre>
* Then let each address withdraw their payouts in separate transactions:
<pre class="hljs js">
    function withdraw() public {
        uint256 amount = owed[msg.sender];
        owed[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
</pre>

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Single-use contracts

<pre class="hljs js">
contract SingleUseContract {
    constructor() public payable {

        // do operations

        <span class="highlight">selfdestruct(msg.sender);</span>
    }
}
</pre>

* Perform operations in a contract's constructor, and then `selfdestruct` when finished
    * One of the few valid use cases for `selfdestruct`: gas refund for single-use contracts
* Like a "throw-away account"

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Beating the house

* Many dApps that depend on randomness have [been found vulnerable](https://blog.positive.com/predicting-random-numbers-in-ethereum-smart-contracts-e5358c6b8620)
* How about the Lottery contract we reviewed previously?
    * Consider what is possible with a single-use contract
    * Note that conditions can be checked after calling a contract, and can optionally revert the entire transaction

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Detecting contract callers

* Can we detect if the caller is a contract?
* Attempt 1 (from [Fomo 3D](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/916xni/how_to_pwn_fomo3d_a_beginners_guide/)):
<pre class="hljs js">
    modifier isHuman() {
        address _addr = msg.sender;
        uint256 _codeLength;

        assembly {_codeLength := extcodesize(_addr)}
        require(_codeLength == 0, "sorry humans only");
        _;
    }
</pre>

    * Doesn't work: code size is 0 inside a contract's constructor

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Detecting contract callers (2)

* Attempt 2:
<pre class="hljs js">  
    modifier isHuman() {
        require(tx.origin == msg.sender, "sorry humans only");
        _;
    }
</pre>

    * Works, but:
    * "Legitimate" contract users cannot use your contract (ex: multi-sig wallets)
    * Ethereum will eventually get rid of `tx.origin`
        * Account abstraction

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Commitment schemes

* All is not lost...
* There *is* a way to create secure randomness on-chain: *commit-reveal protocol*
    * Cryptographic protocol for 2 or more parties to come to a consensus on a value they all can agree is random
    * 2 phases: commit phase, reveal phase

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Commit phase

* Assume two parties: A, B
* Each generates a secret random value
    * A generates r<sub>A</sub>
    * B generates r<sub>B</sub>
* They exchange hashes of their secrets
    * A sends H(r<sub>A</sub>) to B
    * B sends H(r<sub>B</sub>) to A
* Commit phase ends and reveal phase begins...

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Reveal phase

* They now exchange their random values and verify the hashes
    * Now that r<sub>B</sub> is public, A computes H(r<sub>B</sub>) and verifies it's same as was received in commit phase
    * B does the same with r<sub>A</sub>
* Now that both parties have securely shared r<sub>A</sub> and r<sub>B</sub>, these values are combined into the final output
    * Ways to combine: xor ($\oplus$), `+`, `H(A . B)`
</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Commit-reveal security

* This works because the randomness depends on both r<sub>A</sub> and r<sub>B</sub>
* Each party needs to commit to their random number before they can see the other random numbers
* As long as there is sufficient block-time between the commit and reveal phases, miners have no influence

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Failure to reveal

* During the reveal phase, one party will see the other revealed numbers first
* If this party's outcome is bad, they could choose to not reveal their secret number
* The punishment for failing to reveal should be at least as bad as a losing outcome
    * Same for other protocol violations
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Copied commitment

* During the commit phase, one party could submit *the same hash* as the other party
    * Depending on how the secrets are combined, output may be predictable
    * $r \oplus r = 0$
    * $r + r \bmod 2 = 0$
    * Solution: Use non-predictable combine method, or prevent copied commitments in the protocol

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs

* Imagine there are 2 copies of a photograph and there is a small difference between them
* I see the difference but you don't
* How can I prove that I see the difference to you without revealing what the difference is?

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Interactive protocols

* I give you the photos in a particular order
* You take the photos behind your back and either swap them or not (choose randomly)
* I tell you whether you swapped them or not
    * If I'm wrong, I couldn't tell the difference
    * If I'm right, maybe I could
* Iterated protocol: Repeat this 1000 times
    * If I'm right every time you can be pretty sure I can tell the difference

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Re-entrancy

* When a contract calls itself (usually indirectly)
* If a contract is in the middle of an operation and it unexpectedly starts a new operation, this can be security problem
* Typical flow:
    * Contract A calls contract B
    * Contract B calls *back into* contract A

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Global variables

* Global variables are usually the root of the problem
* Contract storage is a global variable
    * It could be in an inconsistent state when calling other contracts
* Not specific to smart contracts
    * Any programming language with callbacks and global variables has this issue

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Deadlock (pseudo-code)

    let globalLock = false;

    function doOperation(callback) {
        waitForGlobalLock();
        globalLock = true;

        let result = doSomeStuff();
        callback(result);

        globalLock = false;
    }

Suppose it's called like this:

    doOperation((result) => {
        doOperation((result) => {
            console.log("Did 2 operations");
        });
    });

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## The DAO

* "Decentralized Autonomous Organization"
* Basically a corporation, but on the blockchain
* Was hacked for $50M
    * Most famous Ethereum security bug
    * Resulted in Ethereum Classic fork
    * Bug was due to unanticipated re-entrancy

</script></section>





<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## The DAO Bug

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balance[msg.sender] >= amount, "no balance");
        msg.sender.call{value:amount}("");
        balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }

* As mentioned, `.call` forwards unlimited gas
    * So, if `msg.sender` is a contract, its fallback function can do lots of stuff
    * Including calling `withdraw` *again*
    * Let's walk through what would happen...

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Attack call-stack

<pre class="hljs js">
Hacker contract: <span class="highlightRed">dao.deposit.value(10)()</span>
Hacker contract: <span class="highlightRed">dao.withdraw(10)</span>
        The DAO:   msg.sender.transfer(10)
Hacker fallback:     <span class="highlightRed">dao.withdraw(10)</span>
        The DAO:       msg.sender.transfer(10)
Hacker fallback:         <span class="highlightRed">dao.withdraw(10)</span>
        The DAO:           msg.sender.transfer(10)
        The DAO:           balance[msg.sender] -= 10
        The DAO:       balance[msg.sender] -= 10
        The DAO:   balance[msg.sender] -= 10
</pre>

* Hacker deposits 10 but withdraws 30

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Re-entrancy guard

<pre class="hljs js">
    bool private locked = false;

    modifier nonReentrant() {
        require(!locked, "re-entrancy detected");
        locked = true;
        _;
        locked = false;
    }
</pre>

* Good solution, but adds 5,000 gas to each call
    * Will be almost free if [EIP-1283](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1283.md) deployed

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Preserve invariants

* Best solution: helps in many ways
* An invariant is something that should always be true
* In the DAO example, the invariant is that `balance[msg.sender]` always holds the amount owed to `msg.sender`
    * Violated: Contract balance was debited but `balance` mapping in storage was not
* Always leave storage in a consistent state when calling other contracts

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Checks-Effects-Interactions

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        // Checks
        require(balance[msg.sender] >= amount, "no balance");

        // Effects
        balance[msg.sender] -= amount;

        // Interactions
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }

* Called the [CEI pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern)
* Note the order of last two operations was swapped from The DAO's version
* Demo : HackSimpleDAO.sol
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Denial of Service

* An attack made to contract that makes it unusable
* It occurs due to unexpected `revert`
    * `receive` or `fallback` reverts on every payment.
* `fallback`/`receive` consuming all gas
    * `assert(false)`  
* Use pull payment pattern to mitigate
* Demo : GameDoS.sol

## Decentralized Finance

* DeFi: Financial systems built with smart contracts as the platform for enforcing rules, instead of legal system
* The intersection of economics and blockchain technology
* Benefits are: transparent and permissionless

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Flash Loans

* Imagine you write a cheque to buy something, then you sell it for a profit and receive a new cheque
* As long as you deposit your new cheque before the cheque you wrote clears, you don't need any balance in your account!

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Flash Loans on Ethereum

* On Ethereum, it works like this:
    * A borrower requests a lending contract to send some ETH or tokens
    * The lender sends the tokens, then invokes a callback into the borrower's code
    * When the borrower's callback returns, the lender verifies that the funds were returned (plus fees)

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Example Flash Lender

    function flashLoan(uint amount) {
        uint origBalance = this.balance;

        msg.sender.transfer(amount);

        // Invoke a function on the caller
        IFlashLoan(msg.sender).onFlashLoan();

        // Make sure the function paid us back
        require(this.balance >= origBalance);
    }
